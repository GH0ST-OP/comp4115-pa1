List all office information, a very simple query to start off part 3!
select * from offices;

Get a count of all the orders. Again another simple query, but they will gradually get more interesting/complex!
select count(*) from orders;

See if any employees have the same first name as the customers. 
select contactfirstname from customers where contactfirstname in (select firstname from employees);

Return the name of any product that has not been purchased. Surprisingly the result is very small.
select productname from products where productcode not in (select productcode from orderdetails where ordernumber in ( select ordernumber from orders));

See if any item was shipped after the date that the customer required it to be shipped. (Someone has some explaining to do!)
select contactfirstname,contactlastname, phone from customers where customernumber in (select customernumber from orders where shippeddate > requireddate);

Check to see if any products are out of stock. (Time to restock!)
select productname, productcode, quantityinstock from products where quantityinstock = 0;

Get a list of employees with their phone number and extension.
select employees.lastname, employees.firstname, offices.phone, employees.extension
    -> from offices
    -> inner join employees
    -> on offices.officecode = employees.officecode;
    
See which customer goes with which sales rep.
select customers.contactlastname, customers.contactfirstname, employees.lastname, employees.firstname, employees.email from customers inner join employees on customers.salesrepemployeenumber = employees.employeeNumber;
